# This is a super simple script to change the trajectory setpoint to
# the current position of the joints.  This is designed to work with
# the JointSplineTrajectoryController, and has to live live in the same
# namespace as the controller, in order to link up correctly to the
# "<controller>/command" and "<controller>/state" topics".
